## 🧭 Orientation (How This Repository Is Used)

### Learning Principles
- Fundamentals before frameworks
- Mathematics before models
- Understanding before speed
- Depth over breadth

### Execution Rules
- Daily commitment: **3–4 focused hours**
- No skipping roadmap stages
- Notes, code, and experiments are version controlled
- If it is not committed, it is not completed

### Tooling
- Python 3.10+
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- PyTorch (primary deep learning framework)
- Jupyter Notebook (local)
- Google Colab / Kaggle (heavy training workloads)
- Git & GitHub for progress tracking

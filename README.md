## Overview

This repository documents my complete journey from beginner to AI/ML Engineer.

It follows a structured, depth-first progression covering:

- Mathematical foundations  
- Python and numerical computing  
- Machine Learning theory and implementation  
- Deep Learning systems  
- Transformers and Large Language Models  
- MLOps and production-oriented ML  
- Research paper implementations  
- End-to-end AI systems  

This is not a tutorial dump.  
This is a disciplined engineering workspace built from first principles.

---

## Mission

The objective of this repository is to:

- Build strong mathematical and computer science foundations  
- Implement ML and DL algorithms from scratch  
- Develop system-level thinking  
- Bridge academic understanding with industry-grade engineering  
- Transition from student → ML Engineer through documented execution  

This repository represents structured growth, not shortcuts.

## Engineering Philosophy

- Fundamentals over hype  
- Clarity over memorization  
- Implementation over theory-only  
- Systems thinking over isolated scripts  
- Consistency over intensity

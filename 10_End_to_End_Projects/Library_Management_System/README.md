# 📚 Library Management System (Python)

A modular, OOP-based Library Management System designed to handle book inventories, member registrations, and
transaction workflows. This project demonstrates clean code principles and efficient data handling.

## 📁 Project Structure

* `book.py`: Defines the `Book` class (attributes like ISBN, Title, Author).
* `member.py`: Defines the `Member` class and borrowing limits.
* `library.py`: The core engine handling the logic for issuing, returning, and searching books.
* `main.py`: The entry point for the command-line interface (CLI).

## ✨ Features

* **Inventory Tracking:** Add, remove, and update book records.
* **Member Management:** Register new members and track their borrowing history.
* **Issue/Return System:** Logic to check book availability before issuing.
* **Search Engine:** Search books by title or author with optimized filtering.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Concepts used:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, List Comprehensions, and File I/O (if applicable).

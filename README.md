</p>

A structured, end-to-end **AI/ML Engineering journey** covering mathematics, machine learning, deep learning, large
language models, MLOps, and production-grade systems.

This repository is built with a strong emphasis on:

- Fundamentals over shortcuts
- Theory + implementation
- Engineering discipline
- Real-world applicability

It is designed as a **long-term learning and engineering workspace**, not a tutorial dump.

---

## Purpose

The objective of this repository is to:

- Build strong mathematical and computer science foundations for AI/ML
- Implement ML and DL algorithms with clear intuition
- Progress from models to **production-oriented ML systems**
- Bridge the gap between academic learning and industry expectations

---

## Repository Scope (High-Level)

- **Mathematics** — linear algebra, calculus, probability, discrete math
- **Python Foundations** — numerical computing and data handling
- **Machine Learning** — classical ML (theory + from-scratch implementations)
- **Deep Learning** — neural networks, optimization, CNNs, RNNs
- **Computer Vision & NLP** — representation learning for images and text
- **LLMs** — transformer internals, fine-tuning, inference pipelines
- **MLOps** — experiment tracking, deployment, CI/CD
- **Research Implementations** — reproducing influential AI papers
- **End-to-End Projects** — complete ML systems from data to deployment

Detailed explanations and implementations live inside individual folders.

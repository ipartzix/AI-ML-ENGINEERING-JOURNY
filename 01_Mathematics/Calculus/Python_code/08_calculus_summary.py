# # Calculus Summary for Machine Learning
# 
# **Purpose:** Consolidate all essential calculus concepts required for ML and DL.


# ## Topics Covered
# - Derivatives
# - Partial Derivatives
# - Chain Rule
# - Gradients
# - Gradient Descent
# - Loss Functions
# - Backpropagation


# ## Must-Remember Formulas
# - $\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x$
# - $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x^2 + y^2) = 2x$
# - $\nabla f = [\partial f/\partial x, \partial f/\partial y]$
# - $\theta = \theta - \eta \nabla L$
# - $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}$


# ## Calculus → ML Mapping
# - Linear Regression → MSE + Gradient Descent
# - Logistic Regression → Cross-Entropy + Gradients
# - Neural Networks → Chain Rule + Backpropagation
# - Deep Learning → Gradient-based Optimization


# ## Completion Checklist
# You are done with calculus if you can:
# - Compute gradients manually
# - Explain backpropagation
# - Implement gradient descent
# - Understand optimization behavior


# ## Final Note
# This calculus level is sufficient for **industry ML, deep learning, and research-level reading**.
# 
# **Move forward. Do not over-study calculus.**

# Titanic Dataset - Basic EDA

## Overview
This project performs basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.  
The objective is to understand the dataset structure and observe simple patterns related to passenger survival.

## Dataset Information
- Total Rows: 891
- Total Columns: 12
- Target Variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## Analysis Performed
- Checked dataset shape and data types
- Identified missing values
- Generated summary statistics
- Visualized Age and Fare distributions
- Compared survival based on Gender and Passenger Class

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Current Status
This project is currently in the learning phase.  
Additional improvements and analysis will be added as new concepts are learned and implemented.

# Progress Log — AI/ML Engineering Journey

This log records **setup, preparation, learning, and execution progress**.
Early weeks focus on environment readiness and resource organization before deep study begins.

---

## Week 0 — Planning & Direction
**Focus:** Roadmap clarity and goal alignment  

**Completed:**
- Finalized AI/ML long-term roadmap
- Defined learning order and priorities
- Decided focus areas (AI/ML engineering, not web development)

**Notes:**
- No coding or study started
- Emphasis on clarity over speed

---

## Week 1 — Environment Setup
**Focus:** System and tooling preparation  

**Completed:**
- Python installed and configured
- Jupyter Notebook setup
- Git and GitHub configured
- Repository structure finalized

**Notes:**
- System prepared for local ML experiments
- No model training attempted

---

## Week 2 — Resource Collection & Organization
**Focus:** Learning materials and references  

**Completed:**
- Collected core AI/ML books (PDFs)
- Shortlisted YouTube course playlists
- Organized resources by topic (Math, ML, DL, LLMs)
- Created notes structure in repository

**Notes:**
- Priority given to quality over quantity
- Avoided starting multiple courses in parallel

---

## Week 3 — Foundation Warm-Up (Light)
**Focus:** Familiarization, not deep study  

**Completed:**
- Reviewed Python basics
- Light NumPy revision
- Skimmed math prerequisites (no deep problem-solving yet)

**Notes:**
- Goal was comfort, not mastery
- Deep study begins only after full setup confidence

---

## Current Status
- Environment: ✅ Ready  
- Resources: ✅ Organized  
- Execution: ⏳ Starting next  

---

## Ground Rules Going Forward
- No rushed learning
- One primary resource per topic
- Notes and code pushed together
- Weak understanding documented honestly

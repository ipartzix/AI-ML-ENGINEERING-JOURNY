# 🤖 AI-ML Engineering Documentation

This folder serves as the central knowledge base for my AI and Machine Learning journey. It contains theoretical papers, library documentation, and mathematical foundations required to build real-world intelligent systems.

## 🧠 Knowledge Pillars

* **Mathematical Foundations:** Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability for ML.
* **Data Engineering:** Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn documentation.
* **Deep Learning:** Neural Network architectures and optimization notes.
* **Computer Vision/NLP:** Documentation for specialized domains.

## 📂 Resource Directory

| Resource Type | File/Reference | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python Foundation** | `pythonBOOK..._compressed.pdf` | Mastering Python for ML scalability. |
| **Mathematics** | *To be added* | Understanding the "Why" behind algorithms. |
| **Project Docs** | [Attendance App] | Specs for the offline attendance system. |

## 🚀 Learning Roadmap
1. **Phase 1:** Solidifying Python & DSA (Current).
2. **Phase 2:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Statistical Modeling.
3. **Phase 3:** Building & Deploying Robotics/IoT integrated AI models.
